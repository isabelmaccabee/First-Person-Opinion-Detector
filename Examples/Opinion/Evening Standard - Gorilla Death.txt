The really divisive issue of the day, setting friend against friend, is, of course, the gorilla question.

Harambe the gorilla versus the little boy who fell into his enclosure in Cincinnati Zoo: Harambe was shot.

As the Mail put it: “Was this gentle giant trying to protect boy he took by the hand?”

Well! If ever there were an issue to reveal basic philosophical differences, it’s this.

As a friend of mine (childless) put it: “Why is the life of a child more important than that of a gorilla?”

Peter Singer, the controversial philosopher, couldn’t have put it more bluntly. 

The weaselly third-way approach is to say that the keepers should have shot it with a tranquilliser dart but another friend passionately pointed out that the dart would have taken 15 minutes to work: “The gorilla could have crushed the child’s head. You don’t know what it could have done.”

So it comes down to the straight choice: gorilla v child, with London pretty well divided down the middle. A colleague takes a robust view: throw the parents into the enclosure and let them sort it out. These are deep waters. I’m staying out of it...
