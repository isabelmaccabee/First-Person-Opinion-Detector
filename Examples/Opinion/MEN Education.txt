There is nothing more important for the future of the UK’s tech industry than training.

As a nation, we’re already lagging behind the rest of the world when it comes to technical skills and the government just isn’t moving quickly enough to tackle the issue.

That’s why Manchester is an extraordinary place for young people to be.

The community is taking charge, businesses are stepping up and technology leaders are taking the matter into their own hands.

Reaching children at primary school level is essential.

These children, in many cases, already have access to cutting edge tech – to smartphones, laptops and tablets – and the school is lagging behind.

Code Clubs give these school children the chance to get hands on with how the tech that they are so familiar with actually works.

They are able to change how it works and tinker around to create new versions.

They are also able to continue the project from any device at home.

It is eye opening and incredibly valuable to pique their interest at such an early stage.

At UKFast, we’re working with more than 40,000 students across Greater Manchester to bring them hands-on tech knowledge and experience. At the last Code Club at UKFast there were 20 children aged between six and 14 who jumped straight into coding with Python.

Some of them were at a better level than many adults I know!

I believe that this is how we will build a strong technology future for the UK and for Manchester, and how we can ensure that Manchester becomes the tech hub of Britain; communities and businesses coming together to tackle the skills gap and its potential effects.
