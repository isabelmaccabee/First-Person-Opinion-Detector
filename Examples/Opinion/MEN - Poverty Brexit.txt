We noticed a slowdown in the institutional market as far back as the third quarter of 2015 before Brexit came into the forefront of people’s minds, due to a lack of new monies flowing into some institutional funds and headwinds from China and general economic bad news on the world stage.

While some are suggesting that the prospect of Brexit is disrupting the markets already, statistics demonstrate investor’s appetite is still extremely strong for the right product.The main current issue is a lack of prime stock coming to the market.

The occupational story is still very positive and we have seen rental growth across all sectors over the past 12 – 18 months.

As a result, the outlook for total return performance in the North West is positive and this will continue to drive the market during the course of 2016.

It is also important to consider that the investment market has seen a huge amount of monies flowing into Manchester as both national and international investors continue to move away from the heated London markets into the regions.

Manchester will continue to benefit from this over the coming years as the region offers real value in comparison to the South East.

This has seen a large number of properties trade hands and business plans are now being implemented to drive performance of those assets.

Clearly, whilst the institutions are a key player for the North West market, it is also important to consider that the private equity funds, property companies and private investors have continued unabated to purchase, regardless of Brexit.

They continue to see value in the region and value in property as an asset class.

In essence the weight of money targeting commercial property is formidable and this will continue to drive the market regardless of Brexit. Property is always seen as a safe haven in times of uncertainty and the issue is one of pricing that risk.
