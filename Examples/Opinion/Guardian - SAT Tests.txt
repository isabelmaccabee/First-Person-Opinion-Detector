Today, thousands of parents are keeping their Key Stage Two children off school as a mark of protest at the SATs exams they face – and as someone who spent several years working in education, I stand with them completely. 
Since my own schooling, I have felt that the pressure we put on children and the importance we place on exam results has been disproportionate and unjustified – but nothing hammered this home for me more than when I was leading classes myself.
Kids are sat in big halls for a week of exams at the early age of just seven-years-old. And from that point until the end of their school years, it never stops. SATs, GCSEs, GNVQs, AS Levels, A Levels… if you’re in a classroom, you are preparing inevitably for the next government test of your learning.
Let kids be kids
40,000 parents have signed a petition calling for schools to ‘Let Kids Be Kids’ and are taking their kids out of school for the day to deliver their own brand of education which involves imagination, creativity, outdoor play and problem solving rather than constant revision.

And this is what should be happening in classrooms – and why most teachers enter the profession. Very few university graduates take on the training to become a teacher because they are thrilled to lead revision sessions and set demonic amounts of holiday homework.
They want to do the job to inspire children, pass on the joy of learning and discover the individual strengths of the youngsters under their care. Which is an impossibility when both staff and students are set daunting targets to reach specific grades.
Why do we do it?
Aside from the fact that by the age of 13, SATs practically mean nothing and it’s all about the GCSE (seriously, nobody puts their SAT results on their CV), the constant testing and assessment is robbing our children of their childhood.
ChildLine confirmed that in the last couple of years, calls relating to exam fears – with the most prominent worry being letting down teachers and parents and the fear of failure – have risen by a staggering 200%. It is estimated that just shy of 10% of those affected will be so daunted that they may even have suicidal thoughts.

Certainly, it is not unknown for the expectations of our children – who are also going through the many pressures of puberty and reaching adulthood – to lead to tragic cases of them being unable to take any more.
These are extreme – but the bottom line remains is that we are unnecessarily stressing out our children and robbing them of their childhood.
We are preventing children from loving to learn
7-year-olds are still at that crucial age of exploration and discovery and this is such an important time to make sure they enjoy learning. Sitting them down in a stuffy room, in exam conditions for a week of tough test papers and letting them know that the results will decide which class they go to is a pretty sure fire way of destroying any potential love of education.
Not only that, but with the placement of exam weeks often falling after school holidays, even children’s breaks are packed with revision. Adults need holidays to recuperate so kids who are still developing most definitely do – instead they spend their days off panicking about the weeks that follow.

Target grades give children the pressure of failure hanging over them and, more often that not, they are completely unreasonable. Academic children especially, who are already ahead of average are being pushed to go even higher. Targeting a child to get A grades is basically telling them they can’t afford a single error – hammering home the lesson that MISTAKES ARE BAD.
This is far beyond teaching children how to cope with failure. This is leaving kids depressed and nervous at an age when they are even less equipped to be able to deal with it.
What do exams actually teach? 
And what do they actually learn from it all? Any driver will tell you that you only actually learn to use a car properly AFTER you pass the test. And the same goes for exams – kids are just being taught how to answer a question to the satisfaction of a marking scheme.
They are fed information and learning is treated as a memory test and an activity of conformity rather than the encouragement to approach a problem independently or creatively. We are churning out a factory of exam passers who might get the grades after a heck of a lot of stress, but can’t think for themselves at the other end.

What should we do? 
Employers are less and less impressed with GCSE results on the whole than they are with the ability to solve problems and think outside of the box. Employers want life experience and deeper knowledge that would be far better gained through projects, coursework and independent activity rather than an exam.
Additionally, we should be teaching life skills such as managing money, socialising and how to enter the working life. This is where work based qualifications have a better approach to learning which should be adopted across the board.
We can gauge if children can read, write and count through many other ways than exam papers and, while occasionally in life, testing is unavoidable, starting from 7-years-old and making it a practically annual constant pressure on children is too much and is leaving them genuinely unhappy. Which is why parents are taking action – seeing your child unhappy and anxious is the last thing that any parent – or indeed teacher – wants.
The hands of teachers are tied
Schools are themselves trapped, given that the pressure is on them for the children to achieve these results too. And when every member of a classroom is feeling this, it can not creative a happy or productive environment. From working in a school, I can’t recall a single colleague who didn’t dread the exam weeks – in part for the workload but also because they simply hated doing it to the children.

Children should be encouraged to talk, make mistakes, socialise, explore and discover in fun ways – lessons like this always brought out the best in the children I taught. But with more and more exams, less resources, more cuts to funding and higher targets, teachers are no longer able to deliver this necessary experience.
If this goes on, we will produce a generation of anxious, disassociated robots – and what an utterly depressing future that is.
