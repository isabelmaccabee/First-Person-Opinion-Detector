By Associated Press June 3 at 10:43 AM   COPENHAGEN, Denmark — France’s interior minister says the Paris police chief wants more security staff to protect fans at the 2016 European Championship, which starts next week. Bernard Cazeneuve, speaking Friday to The Associated Press, denied a report that police chief Michel Cadot suggested closing the Paris fan zone any time there was a match at either Paris stadium for security reasons. The minister says “Mr. Cadot did not say that.” Cazeneuve says “Cadot informed me of the conditions under which he could organize it, meaning the extra staff necessary to be perfectly capable of ensuring security.” Cazeneuve said French authorities “are working now on adjusting staffing to ensure maximum security.” Paris is one of 10 host cities in France for Euro 2016, which runs June 10-July 10.
