The French singer and producer Mai Lan was a big part of many of the best songs from Junk, the new M83 album. And now she’s put together “Technique,” a dizzy rush of a solo track that finds fun ways to play around with the idea that we’re all on the internet way too much. Mai Lan and Max Labarthe co-wrote the song with my friend Nick Sylvester, the man who produced Shamir’s Ratchet album, so I can’t even pretend to be objective here. But disclosures aside, I can tell you that this song fucking rules. So does the video, from French directing team PANAMÆRA, which turns Mai Lan and her dancers into some sort of post-human cartoon. Check it out below.

I don’t know if there’s a Mai Lan album coming, but I can hope.
