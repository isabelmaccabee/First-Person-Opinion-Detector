The mother of Natasha McKenna, 37, of Alexandria, claims sheriff deputies failed to follow proper procedures when they handcuffed, wrestled and then repeatedly used a electric stun gun on her while attempting to transfer her to another jail. The lawsuit, filed in Fairfax County Circuit Court, names as defendants Sheriff Stacey Kincaid and the six-member team that was sent to remove McKenna from her cell in February 2015.  [Fairfax inmate was Tasered while shackled]  The death of McKenna, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 12, prompted an outcry from mental health advocates and the Black Lives Matter movement, saying guards should have used less force and tried to deescalate the confrontation. It also spurred a criminal investigation, which ended in September when Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney Raymond F. Morrogh declined to press charges against the guards involved, saying they showed “restraint” given the circumstances.  [Prosecutor: No charges in the death of Natasha McKenna]  Attorney Harvey Volzer, who is representing McKenna’s mother, said in a statement that the criminal investigation shows that “black persons in Fairfax County must look to the civil courts for justice.”  “Natasha McKenna is a tragic example of how minority and handicapped persons’ rights only get lip service in Fairfax County,” Volzer wrote. Kincaid did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but she has said the guards acted appropriately during a difficult encounter. McKenna, who had been acting erratically for weeks, was arrested in January 2015 by Fairfax County police on an oustanding warrant for assaulting an Alexandria police officer. She reportedly assaulted the officer during a scuffle earlier that month at th Hertz rental car agency. McKenna was transferred to the Fairfax County jail, where over the next eight days Alexandria police failed to pick her up on three occasions because of a delay in communications.  Over that period, McKenna’s mental health declined, she got into alteractions with the guards and soiled her cell. Finally, on Feb. 3, the Fairfax County Sheriff’s Office decided to transfer McKenna itself. A sheriff’s deputy initially coaxed McKenna into handcuffs, but she then grew agitated and started resisting, according to a report prepared by Morrogh. The six-member emergency response team, or SERT, was sent in to restrain her. “You promised me you wouldn’t kill me,” Morrogh, the Commonwealth’s attorney, reported McKenna was heard saying at one point. The guards wrestled McKenna to the ground, while she cursed and tried to bite them, according to Morrogh’s report. McKenna was eventually shocked with an electric stun gun four times to bring her under control. Morrogh reported that McKenna was breathing for several minutes after being subdued, but was found unresponsive after being transferred to a loading bay in the jail. She was eventually revived, but later died at the hospital. A state medical examiner ruled that McKenna’s death was an accident linked to the use of the stun gun and being restrained. Her death was attributed to a rare condition called “excited delirium,” in which a person with a mental illness or on drugs grows so agitated his or her heart gives out. The sheriff’s office eventually released a graphic video of the encounter.           Local Crime & Safety Alerts Breaking news about public safety in and around D.C.
