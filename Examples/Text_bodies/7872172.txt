In an outfit hot enough to melt the contents of the freezer cabinet, the scantily-clad man clearly knows he’s rocking his look as he browses for an ice-cream.Making sure he bends over just far enough to show off his pert behind, the man indulges in a series of saucy moves using the cabinet as his dancing prop.With the perfect sexy beats playing in the background he works the shop floor like a pro.Taking his time – and giving any admiring fans as many flashes of thigh as possible – the cheeky guy finally picks out what looks like a chocolate Cornetto.

CHOICES, CHOICES: The sassy dude shows off his best assets while he picks an ice cream

Strutting off to the drinks aisle, he gives the shop a better view of his tiny pink thong, strappy black bra top and black patent platform boots.After deciding against a cold drink – let’s face it, he’s cool enough already – the fashionista really dominates that aisle, using it as his own personal catwalk.Hand on hip he sashays past the crisps and nuts section towards the waiting cashier, giving him the eyeful he knows he really wants.Clapping and squealing he’s truly delighted with his purchase, though goodness knows how he’ll pay for it – as one social media user commented: “Just don’t ask where he keeps his money.” 

However, most people were seriously impressed with his mastery of super-high heels, with dozens of girls praising his steady moves.One even said he must be “Superman” to wear spikes so high.If so, perhaps he could use his special power of super-human sassiness to fight crimes like this one in Surrey, where a drag queen robber was caught red handed when his skirt and wig fell off during an attempted jewellery heist.
