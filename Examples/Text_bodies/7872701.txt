A spokesman for police told the Essex Chronicle they are aware of the video but are not treating Hurford’s death as suspicious.

He said: ‘We are aware of videos filmed and published by a third party circulating on social media purporting to show an encounter between the arrested man and a member of the public but cannot comment further at this stage.

‘In line with legislation Essex Police has referred this matter to the IPCC.’
