60 year-old rapist jailed for 11 years

Kasungu first Grade Magistrate court on Tuesday sentenced a 60 year-old man to 11 years imprisonment with hard labour for raping a 12 year old girl.

Kasungu Police Deputy Public Relations Officer Harry Namwaza confirmed the development to Malawi24 and identified the rapist as Tende Efudala.

Namwaza said the court heard that on February 7 this year the convict went to the victim’s house and asked her to accompany him to a butchery to buy meat.

As they were coming back from the butchery, the wicked old man dragged the victim into a nearby bush where he started to rape her.

“Another man who had seen Efudala with the victim passing his house became suspicious and started following them,” he said.

According to Namwaza, the man found Efudala raping the girl and he apprehended him with the help of the other community members.

In court, State Prosecutor for Kasungu Inspector Griffin Luhanga asked the court for a stiff punishment.

Before passing the judgement on May 31, Kasungu First Grade Magistrate Damiano Banda said Efudala’s behaviour really showed that he is a menace to the society especially to young girls. Banda later sentenced Efudala to 11 years imprisonment with hard labour.

Tende Efudala hails from Kamsamiro village in the area of Traditional Authority (T/A) Kabudula in Lilongwe district.
