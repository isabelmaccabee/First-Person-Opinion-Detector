A sizeable "gender pay gap" in children's pocket money has emerged over the past year, according to the Halifax's annual pocket money survey.The study, which involved more than 1200 children and 575 parents, shows that boys are being given an average of £6.93 per week – almost 13 per cent more than the £6.16 typically given to girls. Last year there was also a gender gap in favour of boys of two per cent.The overall average given by parents was £6.55 per week, the highest since before the financial crisis in 2007. But Giles Martin, head of Halifax Savings, told the BBC it will "be a few more years until we reach the dizzy heights of £8.37 in 2005", an all-time high since the survey began in 1987.Amounts paid across the country range from a high of £8.55 a week in London to a low of £4.96 in East Anglia.The survey notes that boys are more likely to complain than girls that they are not receiving enough money. "This year, 44 per cent of boys said they thought their parents should give them a rise, compared to 39 per cent of girls," notes the Financial Times.Lindsay Cook, co-founder of the consumer website Money Fight Club, says this reflects one of the issues "in the modern workplace", where the Office for National Statistics currently estimates that there is a pay gap of 9.4 per cent. "I suspect there is an element of 'if you don't ask, you don't get' as some little girls are probably too nice to ask for more," she commented.Psychologist Claudia Hammond, author of Mind Over Money, said: "It's interesting that in the survey, the boys think they deserve more money as well."Also, what is going on with the parents here?" she asked. "It's unlikely you've got twins where there's a boy and a girl and the parents have decided to pay them different amounts. These are all averages and so it does mean that people without maybe having kids of both genders [are] deciding perhaps that the boys need more."
