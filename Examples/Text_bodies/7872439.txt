JOHANNESBURG - Its emerged mine workers at Lily’s Mine are still yet to be paid.

Trade union Solidarity says the mine was already two months in arrears and was meant to pay workers their April salaries today.

The mine was placed under business rescue, putting 900 jobs on the line following a shaft collapse at its Barberton operation in February.

Pretty Nkambule, Solomon Nyerende and Yvonne Mnisi are still unaccounted for following the tragedy.

Solidarity’s Secretary General Gideon du Plessis says, “It didn’t materialise as the funding didn’t take place from an international funder and those people who were retrenched are unable to claim UIF.”Du Plessis says workers' emotions are running high and they've now become desperate.

“Nearly all the Lily Mine workers who were renting the houses were kicked out of the accommodation and their children are going to school on empty stomachs.”
