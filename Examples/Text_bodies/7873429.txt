Niall Horan has been keeping himself busy while on the One Direction hiatus with golf and soccer and we're seriously loving the new photos of him and Louis Tomlinson battling it out on the field!

Not only has Nialler been dabbling into sports but he also admitted he's been in the studio working on some music and writing. While he denies a solo career, he didn't deny joining a new boy band! Wait...what.

So, here are the deets. There's three guys and two are much older than Niall but we think they could be a huge success!
