His years out of the game had meant he had lost the speed and reflexes he had shown in his twenties, and few involved in the sport gave the former champion a chance of winning contest.

Ali during the fight devised a method which would later become known as the 'Rope-A-Dope', where he retreated to the ropes and let Foreman strike him at will while covering up, deflecting and counterpunching.

Midway through the fight, a frustrated Foreman had worn himself out in the Kinshasa heat, throwing punches that didn't land squarely or were blocked by Ali.
