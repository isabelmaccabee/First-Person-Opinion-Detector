Fresh from winning the Irish novel of the year award, Anne Enright has been declared the favourite to take this year’s Baileys women’s prize for fiction.

A reunion dominates this moving family drama but it’s the distinct individual stories that fascinate

Enright, Ireland’s fiction laureate, won the €15,000 (£11,500) Kerry Group novel of the year award earlier this week for The Green Road. About four children returning to the west coast of Ireland as their mother prepares to sell the family home, it is also in the running for the Baileys prize, now with odds of 5/2 from William Hill to win the £30,000 award when it is announced on 8 June.

The second favourite was another Irish author, Lisa McInerney, whose debut novel The Glorious Heresies was given odds of 3/1 to take the Baileys. In joint third place, according to William Hill, are American author Hanya Yanagihara’s bestselling A Little Life and fellow American Cynthia Bond’s debut Ruby, both at 9/2.

Film director Hannah Rothschild’s debut The Improbability of Love, which jointly won the Wodehouse prize for comic fiction last week, was given odds of 11/2, while American author Elizabeth McKenzie was the outsider for her novel The Portable Veblen, at 15/2.

The award, formerly known as the Orange, was launched in 1996 after the Booker shortlist of 1991 failed to include a single woman. It goes to the best piece of full-length fiction written in English by a woman from anywhere in the world, and has been won in the past by names from Linda Grant to Ali Smith and Andrea Levy. This year’s judging panel is chaired by Margaret Mountford, deciding together with novelist Elif Shafak, journalists Naga Munchetty and Laurie Penny, and writer and singer Tracey Thorn.
