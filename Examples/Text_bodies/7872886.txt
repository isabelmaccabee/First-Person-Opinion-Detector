PANAJI: Senior

Congress

leader

Digvijaya Singh

today accused

Delhi Chief Minister

and

AAP

national convener

Arvind Kejriwal

of misusing public money to build his own image. "The funds for publicity in Delhi government have been increased seven-fold. Kejriwal is using public money to build his own image," Singh told reporters here in an apparent reference to AAP's "Ek Saal" campaign marking its first anniversary in office. AAP is trying to make inroads into Goa and had already announced its move to contest Assembly elections next year. Singh said the Congress will "expose" AAP and the

BJP

on their "wrongdoings". "We will go to the people with the facts," the AICC general secretary said. He also downplayed the maiden public rally conducted recently by Kejriwal in Goa. "Kejriwal made only tall announcements on development. But the fact is that the party (AAP) has spent seven times more than the previous government in Delhi on its campaign," Singh said. He further alleged that the infrastructure in Delhi is "completely grounded" and the experiment like odd-even formula is a complete flop. The Congress leader was here to release a book titled "Public Matters", written by former minister of State for External Affairs

Eduardo Faleiro

on his speeches in Parliament.
