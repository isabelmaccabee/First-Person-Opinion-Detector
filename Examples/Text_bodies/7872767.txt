The menteri besar, who is also Perak UMNO Liaison Committee chairman, said BN's approach had always been making realistic pledges which could implemented for the voters. 

He said in the Kuala Kangsar by-election, BN would continue the manifesto of its late MP Datuk Wan Mohammad Khair-il Anuar Wan Ahmad.  

"It is most important for us to explain issues manipulated by other parties (opposition) and continue with the pledges of the earlier manifesto," he told reporters after opening a "Civil Servants with the Menteri Besar" event  and a briefing on current issues by the Congress of Unions of Employees in the Public and Civil Services (Cuepacs) here today. 

Commenting on the announcement of the Pakatan Harapan candidate yesterday, Zambry, who is also Perak BN chairman, said the party was prepared to accept the challenge of any candidate. 

"We have no objections. It is their right to nominate anybody. Or for that matter, any other parties wanting to field any candidate.  

"BN will face them in our way, our method and we will give our best to the people," he said. 

Yesterday, Pakatan Harapan named former Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) professor, Dr Ahmad Termizi Ramli as its candidate for the by-election.  

The by-election was called following the death of MP Datuk Wan Mohammad Khair-il Anuar Wan Ahmad, in a helicopter crash in Sarawak on May 5.  

Earlier in his speech, Zambry announced an annual allocation of RM100,000 to Perak Cuepacs starting this year to enable the congress carry out its activities. 

Before this, the state government gave allocations based on the application of the organisation, he said. ― Bernama
