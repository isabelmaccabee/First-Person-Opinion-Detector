A section of Muslim clerics from the North Rift  region have petitioned the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) to suspend its weekly protests against the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) in respect of the Holy month of Ramadhan that starts on June 6th.

Led by the chairman of the Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya in the North Rift region, Sheikh Abubakar Bini Said, the leaders stated that it would be a noble idea for the opposition to accord Muslims the necessary peace and calmness they require during the Holy month of prayer and fasting.Also Read: CORD to resume anti-IEBC protests Monday

“Whether they will have come to a consensus with the government or not, we request the opposition to suspend the street demonstrations in respect of the Holy month because some of demonstrators are Muslims,” pointed Sheikh Abubakar.

At the same time the leaders hailed the government for waiving duty on dates during the Holy month of Ramadhan.

The fruit is traditionally the first food Muslims break their daily fast with in the evening.
