It's being speculated that actor Zac Efron is doing his best to copy Justin Bieber's super bleach blond hairdo! Zac visited an elementary school this week and debuted his brand new look, which we must say is something totally new for the former High School Musical actor.

Zac shared about his time in school, "#tbt to when I graduated preschool. Srsly though, some days are meant to be and thanks to the 'Smiling Sons' class for reminding me what's important in life. Just be yourself and play hard #hustlekindness"

That's so sweet! We're glad Zac had a fun trip visiting some young fans and helping teach the importance of school.
