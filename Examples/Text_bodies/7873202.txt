Donny Everett, a freshman right-hander for the Vanderbilt baseball team, died in a drowning accident while fishing Thursday night at Normandy Lake in Manchester, Tenn., about an hour southeast of the school’s campus in Nashville. He was 19.  “We learned last night of the tragic death of Donny Everett, an outstanding young man who exemplified the best of our university,” Commodores Athletic Director David Williams said in a statement Friday morning. “As you can imagine, the team, the athletic department and the university are trying to come to terms with this tragedy. His parents and loved ones are on our minds and in our prayers as we share in their grief.” Vanderbilt, the 2014 College World Series champion and 2015 runner-up, is scheduled to begin NCAA regional play Friday night against Xavier in Nashville. According to the Tennessean, the status of the game “has not yet been decided because the university is still gathering information.” Emergency crews in Coffee County, Tenn., were called to a drowning at Normandy Lake, a popular fishing and swimming spot, at 5 p.m. Thursday. In a statement released Friday, the Coffee County Sheriff’s Department said Everett was with two teammates and two other people when he tried to swim across the lake near a bridge. Divers found him 15 feet from shore. Williams was a heralded recruit out of Clarksville High in Tennessee, joining the Commodores after being drafted in the 29th round of last year’s MLB draft by the Milwaukee Brewers. According to a report last year by Jon Heyman, then of CBS Sports, Williams would have been a first-round pick and received a signing bonus of $2.5 million had pro teams not known that he intended to attend college. He missed the first half of the season because of injury but made six appearances and two starts, striking out 13 in just 12 innings of work.
