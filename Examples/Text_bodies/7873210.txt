CAPE TOWN - KFC in Botswana has confirmed it has temporarily closed some of its restaurants after the brand was placed under provisional liquidation.

The fast food franchise says a provisional liquidator has been appointed to oversee its finances while the process continues

KFC says it’s working with the liquidator to prevent the stores’ closure.

 Marketing director Thabisa Mkwanazi says 400 jobs are at stake.

“We may experience intermittent or temporary closures across the stores and we do have the provisional liquidators in market right now who are closely working with the team. At this current point, we have 12 stores. Some stores are closed but not permanently because it’s a legal process.”

Mkwanazi says none of KFC’s 825 restaurants in South Africa are in danger of closing.
