In honor of our guests, this final round is music-themed. We've taken the names of bands from the Recording Industry Association of America's list of the 300 best-selling artists of all time, and have replaced them with rough antonyms. For example, if we said "Videofeet," you would answer, "Radiohead."   Heard on Bob Boilen And Gaelynn Lea: What's In Your Tiny Desk?
