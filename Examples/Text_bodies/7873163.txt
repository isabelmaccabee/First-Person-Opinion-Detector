He said: “The likely reason why the prices have gone up over the past few years. “It’s something you don’t really see much push back on.” When asked if people could ask to use another crematorium, rather than their local one, he added: “There’s nothing stopping them. “A good funeral director will offer this anyway. “The worst will say that it’s not possible.” Dignity Funerals and Heart of England Crematorium were contacted by the Telegraph for a comment.
