Glamour model Rhian Sugden, who was at the centre of Vernon Kay’s sexting scandal, has been rushed to hospital with chest pains brought on by stress.

The Daily Star has reported that friends are very concerned about her well-being after she apparently fainted at Euston Station in London, just six days earlier.

Rhian was taken to A&E in Manchester after she complained of chest pains after, apparently, struggling to cope with the amount of abuse she has received since the Vernon affair blew up again.

A source close to the Page 3 girl spoke to the Daily Star, saying: “After taking herself to the doctor with a tight chest and pains in her arm, they have taken Rhian straight up to hospital.

“With all the stress from the death threats and people threatening to harm her family, Rhian has been finding it difficult to cope and it’s taking its toll on her.”

Rhian, 29, is believed to having test run on her while she is laid up in hospital but it is believed that her condition is not life-threatening.

The Daily Star source continued: “Her family and fiancé Oliver are really worried about her. She hasn’t been eating properly and is struggling to power on through all the abuse.”

The model had opened up previously about the level of abuse she has been subjected to, with rape threats and trolls urging her to kill herself becoming a daily part of her life.

Rhian has said: “I have always had the odd random sick message from weirdos in the past, but yes, since the Vernon thing I have been threatened with rape and all sorts. Sometimes over Twitter and on Instagram messages and comments.

“Somebody tweeted me saying I deserved to die and I should drown myself. I’ve been told to go and hang myself. People are disgusting.”
