Saturday, 4 June 2016 - 2:27am

In the early hours of Saturday 4th June 2016 Police had received numerous phone calls about the behaviour of youths congregating and driving of cars in the Palmerston North area.

At 1.20am Police received reports of a serious motor crash between two vehicles on Railway Road, Palmerston North.

All Emergency Services responded including Fire and ambulance.

Two of about 40 ‘boy racer’ type cars had collided with each other.

One occupant of one of the vehicles received moderate injuries and another received minor injuries.

Both cars needed to be towed away and they are considered to be ‘write offs’.

Police enquiries are continuing into the crash.

Police are disappointed that with the start of the long weekend that complaints of poor driving has taken place in such a manner.  Driving safety is an essential part of driving that is required to help reduce injuries and trauma on the roads, as the social costs of crashes is huge.
