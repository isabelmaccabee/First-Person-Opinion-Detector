More downpours are forecast for the weekend across a band of central Europe from France to Ukraine.At least 11 people have died in the past week as a result of the flooding in Europe and several towns in southern Germany have been devastated, with thousands being forced from their homes. Belgium, Austria, the Netherlands and Poland have also been affected.

Their chief executive David Jennings said all museums "have a disaster plan"."For us, and it'll be the same for the Louvre, it depends on what your information is and the time frame you have for understanding the disaster that's about to happen.

The museum was hit by water from the flooded River Foss

"The first thing is to protect the public and your staff. Then, the thing that's most important is protecting the collection."We closed the museum as soon as we could see there was a risk of flooding, and did the same thing the Louvre is doing to move the artefacts from the basement up to a safe place."We already had in place the basics of protection from water - and our conversation now is about how we enhance that protection in the future."It's about trying to put in place flood barriers at the entrances and the doors - they are the weak spots of any basemented building."
