Todd Sorenson stood in the lobby of his small apartment complex in a quiet residential neighborhood here late Thursday night, his eyes bleary from a lack of sleep.                   The roofer, who lived one floor below UCLA shooter Mainak Sarkar, said news of the attack has left many in an otherwise peaceful community confused.                   "It scared the crap out of me," Sorenson said as his TV blared from his second-floor studio overhead. A row of mailboxes stood behind him. "Sarkar #8," read one.                   Sorenson, 49, said he didn't speak with Sarkar much -- their only encounters were less than friendly. Sarkar would tell him not to smoke cigarettes out of the window below his, Sorenson said. The last time they spoke was a year ago, he added, when he slammed the door in Sarkar's face.                   Since the police showed up Wednesday night to investigate the case, Sorenson said, some of the neighbors have expressed shock.                   "Oh my God, do I have to move?" Sorenson recalled one of his neighbors asking.                   "It was scary for a lot of people, that someone like that would kill people," he said. "We're regular folk around here. You don't expect it."                   Sorenson said the police didn't leave until early Thursday morning. Officers took a couple of packages from the apartment and blew them up in containers outside to make sure they weren't dangerous, he said.                   Although police said the residents weren't in danger, Sorenson said he was still shaken up by the news.                   "That freaks me out. That really freaks me out," he said. "It's a good neighborhood with good people."
