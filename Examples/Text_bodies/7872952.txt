Mike Fennell, president of the Jamaica Olympic Association, has refused to confirm or deny the news, while the man listed as the athleteâ€™s representative failed to respond to repeated attempts to contact him.

Carter, 30, is the sixth fastest 100m sprinter of all time with a personal best 9.78sec set in 2010, although 100m bronze at the 2013 World Championships is the only major individual medal of his career.

He has also won two Olympic and three world titles as part of an all-conquering Jamaican 4x100m team led by Bolt over the past six years.
