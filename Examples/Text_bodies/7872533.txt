By Associated Press June 3 at 10:24 AM   WARSAW, Poland — Police in central Poland are on standby as hundreds of Hells Angels bikers’ clubs from around Europe and the U.S. are gathering near Warsaw for an annual meeting. Police were checking the documents and luggage of some of the bikers, as they were arriving Friday at the gate of the enclosed holiday center in Rynia, on a man-made lake. TVN24 showed police stopping bikers and checking their documents on a highway leading from Germany. The club has gained a bad reputation in the U.S. due to the involvement of some of its members in deadly fights in recent years. Lately, its yearly “Hells Angels World Run” meetings have been held outside the U.S. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
