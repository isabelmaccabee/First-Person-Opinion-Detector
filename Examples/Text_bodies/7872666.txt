The first Friday of June is National Donut Day. It's also the perfect time to satisfy your sweet tooth and be a little geeky at the same time.Rosanna Pansino’s YouTube geek baking show Nerdy Nummies has released a video showing off an easy way to make delicious Lord of the Rings-themed donuts. You don't even need to bake them. Just pick up some of your favorite donuts from the store, along with different icing colors, and you're all set.Pansino also shows viewers how to make a donut that looks like the One Ring, another that looks like the door to Bag End, and a donut with an Evenstar on it. She even applies the Tolkienian theme to her wardrobe and wears a Lord of the Rings dress from Black Milk Clothing while she works.If Lord of the Rings doesn’t interest you, you might want to check out Pansino’s video for making Simpsons glazed donuts instead. You can see more of her Nerdy Nummies videos on her YouTube channel.Photo via Rosanna Pansino/Facebook
