For most of us, a major breakup is followed by a night crying on the couch. But if you're Gigi Hadid, it means hitting the town with your famous friends, and looking so great your ex-boyfriend will regret every mistake he ever made.

After splitting with Zayn, Gigi hit the town in an outfit that felt effortless and bold at the same time. She wore a cut-off Rolling Stones t-shirt, sheer leggings and ankle boots, accessorized with a long charm necklace (her Zayn nameplate necklace is, of course, missing).

Take it from Gigi: a night out partying with your girlfriends — in a killer outfit — is the best way to get over your breakup. Shop her look in the slideshow ahead.
