Forget guitars and keyboards – it’s all about makeshift instruments for Bear's Den.

Folk rock duo  Andrew Davie and Kevin Jones have released the second half of their new documentary to give fans an insight into the recording process of their forthcoming album, Red Earth & Pouring Rain.

Shot at Rockfield Studios in rural Wales, the four minute video opens with Jones tapping ominously on a large sheet of metal in a bid to get some new instrumental inspiration.

After voicing their satisfaction with the “cool” sound, the band go on to incorporate the makeshift instrument into new track, Roses On A Breeze.

The band are later seen discussing the “standard verse beat” before recording their harmonies on Gabriel and breaking into laughter while working on Napoleon.

Fans are also given a glimpse of the group as they tuck into dinner, crack open some drinks and relax with a game of table tennis while enjoying a break from piecing together the album.

The video comes a week after Standard Online gave fans an exclusive look at part one - which tracked the taking shape of songs such as Pompeii.

Red Earth & Pouring Rain is a follow up to the band’s 2014 Ivor Novello-nominated debut, Islands.

The album earned them a cult following and saw them championed by Mumford and Sons.

The guys will hit the road later this year for a summer of gigging before wrapping up in Bristol in November.

Red Earth & Pouring Rain is released on July 22 via Communion and is available to pre-order from the band’s official website bearsdenmusic.co.uk.
