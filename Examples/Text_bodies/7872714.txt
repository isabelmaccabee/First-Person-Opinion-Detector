Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt could lose one of his gold medals from the 2008 games in Beijing due to doping.

The Jamaican does not seem to be implicated himself, but could be stripped of one of his medals due to his team-mate Nesta Carter testing positive for a banned substance, according to BBC Sport.

Carter’s ‘A’ sample has come up positive, but the 30-year-old will only face sanctions if the same result comes up after investigation of his ‘B’ sample.

This news is the latest development in an investigation of 454 samples from 2008.

It also comes in the wake of 23 athletes from London’s 2012 games failing retrospective doping tests in a year where doping has reared its ugly head.

This would not be the first time an entire team was stripped of its medals, as the USA men’s relay team were also punished in the same way in 2012 due to Tyson Gay’s drug ban.
