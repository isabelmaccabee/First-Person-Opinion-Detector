Curators from some of the world’s most renowned art institutions will be in Malta this August as part of a school for emerging local curators.The curatorial school will combine lectures and interactive workshops to help over 150 local art practitioners and students exchange ideas with international counterparts and initiate more long-term projects and relations with foreign institutions.International guest speakers include Yuko Hasegawa (The Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo), Fumihiko Sumitomo (Arts Maebashi, Japan), Renate Buschmann (Director of imai, Dusseldorf), Antje Weitzel (The Berlin Biennale), Michaela Crimmin (The Royal College of Art, London), Sebastian Cichocki (The Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw), Nadim Samman (The Moscow International Biennale for Young Art) and Suzanne Wallinga (A Tale of a Tub project).This year’s theme is Curating the New. Participants will explore how contemporary art curators negotiate ideas and commission new work from artists, as well as the ownership and definition of 'new' ideas in curated exhibitions, how artists and curators negotiate 'new' ideas and emerging practices and 'new' media with each other, and what new dialogues are initiated by curators between artists in group showsThe school is jointly organised by the Valletta 2018 Foundation and the University of Malta and is now in its third year. It is directed by Raphael Vella.Artists, curators and students interested in taking part can apply online at http://valletta2018.org/registration until the 24th June.
