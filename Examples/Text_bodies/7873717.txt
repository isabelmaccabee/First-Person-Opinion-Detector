LONDON - Southampton manager Ronald Koeman is to hold talks over filling the vacancy at Premier League rivals Everton, British media reported on Friday.

Southampton's Dutch manager Ronald Koeman has a year left on his Southampton contract and the south coast club are believed to have put a new offer to him	Last month saw Everton sack Roberto Martinez, with Dutch boss Koeman immediately suggested as a candidate to replace the Spaniard at the Merseyside club.But Koeman has a year left on his Southampton contract, having taken charge in August 2014, and the south coast club are believed to have put a new offer to him as well.Southampton were sixth in last season's Premier League and have qualified for the Europa League.By contrast, Everton finished in 11th place.But the Daily Telegraph reported on Thursday that Koeman, having returned from holiday, was interested in what Everton had to say.Koeman is regarded as the favoured target of new Everton majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri and could command an increased salary at Goodison Park.He could also be given greater funds in the transfer market than those currently available to him at Southampton.That could tempt the Dutch great to move to Everton, with Koeman having made it clear he would be unhappy to oversee the sale of key Southampton players following major upheavals in each of the past two years at St Mary's.Koeman, asked if his future was at Southampton, said last month: "Yes... (I can tell you) nothing, because I am the manager of Southampton."Everybody knows I have one year left on my contract and we will sit together and analyse this season and we will talk about the future and that is what the news is today," the former Netherlands international added."What is good is that the club are happy with the work, together with the technical staff and the players, that we have done."There is a very good understanding between the manager and the players and that is good because it is important to continue."So let's do our job this weekend and there is time enough before I go on holiday to have a talk about the future of the club."Everything can happen very fast and that is no problem."
