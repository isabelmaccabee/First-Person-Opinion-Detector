BROOK PARK, Ohio -- A Brook Park man, 20, and his 13-year-old brother were threatened and nearly robbed by males with a gun May 28.

It happened at about 11:15 p.m. as the victims were walking near Smith Road and Fayette Boulevard. A "dark car" with at least two passengers drove up to them and stopped.

One of the backseat passengers drew a black pistol and showed it to the victims. He demanded the man's wallet.

As the man started to hand over his wallet, another car drove up, and the males in the dark car drove away.

Police did not have descriptions of the males with the weapon. Their car was a four-door, possibly blue or black.

Call Brook Park police at 216-433-1239.
