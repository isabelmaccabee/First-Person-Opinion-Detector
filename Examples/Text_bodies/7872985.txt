R&B veteran Maxwell is more than 20 years deep in the game, but he spent seven of those years away from music after 2009’s BLACKSummers’night. That album was the first in a trilogy, and he’s finally back with the long-anticipated second installment, the confusingly titled BlackSUMMERS’night. We’ve heard and seen visuals for lead single “Lake By The Ocean,” and today we receive the followup, “1990x,” in the form of a lyric video. “1990x” is another meticulously crafted R&B song with a huge, catchy hook. Maxwell sings in his gorgeous falsetto, “There’s no song that defines it/ There’s no music behind it/ There’s no lyric to read from/ It’s just you and the moment.” If these first two tracks are any indication, BlackSUMMERS’night will be an exquisitely shaped body of elegant R&B grooves and sultry sentiments well worth the seven-year wait. Listen.
