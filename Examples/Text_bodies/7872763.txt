Paige Spiranac can now post on Instagram with her head held high.

The golf stunner, who became an Internet sensation last season thanks to her penchant for sultry selfies, notched her first victory as a professional this week when she topped the field at a Cactus Tour event in Scottsdale, Ariz.

Spiranac closed with an impressive 4-under 68 on Wednesday to force a playoff with top amateur Hannah O’Sullivan at Orange Tree Country Club. The Cactus Tour is a series of women’s events in the Phoenix area.

Spiranac turned pro after graduating from San Diego State last year, and her Internet popularity helped her garner an invite to the Dubai Ladies Masters in December. Spiranac shot 12-over and missed the cut in the event, which led to a little criticism from her fellow competitors and a lot of mocking on the social media channels that made her famous.

Spiranac even said she was going to take a break from Instagram in an attempt to re-focus her game. Though her self-imposed ban did not last very long, this win is a positive step toward making the sport her full-time profession.
