JOHANNESBURG - There is great anticipation ahead of Standard & Poor’s Global is expected rating announcement in the next few hours.

Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan along with the Treasury, business and unions have been lobbying to keep the country from falling into junk status.

But, the country has been struggling with economic growth, with latest estimates saying it’s around point-five percent.

The local economy has faced a number of challenges since December when President Jacob Zuma fired Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene, sending the rand into tailspin.

There was a drop in business and investor confidence.

However ahead of the announcement, the local currency has improved by around two percent - trading at around R15.29 to the dollar and R22.25 to the pound.

Hopefully, S&P’s Global will decide not to downgrade the country to sub-investment level - and the country will be given another chance to show that if can achieve sustained growth.
