Breathtaking footage showing the moment butterflies invaded a Puerto Rican beach in their thousands has emerged online. Filing the skies in their thousands and creating a wonderful glow as they flutter around, the beautiful butterflies at Crash Boat Beach, in the municipality of Aguadilla in north-western Puerto Rico, are a spectacular sight. Spectacular video and images of the phenomenon were posted to social media by beach-goers who were presumably amazed by what they saw. It is thought the swarm of butterflies were passing through the paradise-like beach during their annual migration from North America to central Mexico.    Read more:

According to meteorologist Deborah Martorell this phenomenon is due to the rainy season, which marks the start of the summer. Entomologist Luis Hernandez explained that when it begins to rain the plants that the caterpillars eat begin to sprout new leaves. He said: "The new leaves grow which are what the slugs feed on. Therefore when the rain comes the caterpillars hatch from their eggs and begin to feed off the new leaves sprouting due to the rains."  Read more:

Hernandez explained that there was no reason for concern as this explosion of the butterfly population is good for the environment. It will encourage pollination which as well as helping agricultural zones will strengthen the food chain of species such as birds and lizards, he added. Hernandez said: "The migrations come with the winds. They may even move into the mountains, they can travel far looking in the coastal areas for the plants they feed off as adults."
