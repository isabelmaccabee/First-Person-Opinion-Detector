By Associated Press June 3 at 10:00 AM   ZAGREB, Croatia — Croatia’s prime minister says he won’t resign despite a crisis in his governing center-right coalition, and is urging his two deputies to step down instead. The senior governing party, the Croatian Democratic Union, and its junior partner, the Most group, each have a deputy prime minister. The crisis erupted when Most recently said it would support an opposition motion to replace its partner’s deputy PM. The clash fueled speculation that Prime Minister Tihomir Oreskovic, a financial expert with no party affiliation, would quit — paving the way for an election only months after the government was formed. Oreskovic said Friday: “I am not resigning and I didn’t plan to.” He insisted a snap vote is not necessary. He argued that both his deputies should step down to end the deadlock.
