Two Britons were among 10 people killed after suspected terrorists set off a car bomb and stormed a hotel in the Somali capital earlier this week. Mohamoud Mohamed Gure, 61, and Abdullahi Jama, 59, went to the country four years ago to stamp out corruption and “rebuild” the nation of their birth by becoming MPs, friends and family told the Evening Standard. As mourners gathered at Mr Gure’s home in north London, his nephew Abdul Derow said: “The terrorists do not like anyone involved in politics. “He was trying to help Somalia get stability, peace and order, but now that opportunity cannot happen.”

“Mohamoud knew it was risky but he decided to help and work hard. It was his life’s work to bring peace to Somalia and if anyone could do that, it was him.” The suicide car bomber crashed his vehicle into a gate outside the Hotel Ambassador - frequented by lawmakers and popular with Westerners - in Mogadishu on Wednesday. Witnesses heard gunfire, with a cloud of smoke seen rising from the area. Al Qaeda-affiliated al Shabaab militants quickly claimed responsibility for the attack.

"A suicide car bomber has targeted the Hotel Ambassador along Maka Al Mukaram Road, Colonel Ali Mohamed, a Mogadishu police officer, told Reuters. "He rammed into the gate. It is too early to know casualties."  Maka Al Mukaram is a major street that links another major artery, K4, to the presidential palace, and it is lined with hotels, restaurants and banks in the heart of the capital. In other incidents, Somali security forces killed 17 al Shabaab fighters including the head of their intelligence unit and a man suspected to have orchestrated a deadly attack on a Kenyan university in 2015, government officials said.

This latest attack comes after a string of shocking terror violence carried out by al-Shabaab in recent months. The Islamist group claimed responsibility for the Daallo Airlines blast which blew an alleged suicide bomber out of a hole in the side of a plane. It comes after reports the Somalia plane bomber may have had some type of link to the airline or airport staff.
