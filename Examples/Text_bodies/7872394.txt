The Bermuda Government plans to remedy the shortcomings of the 2008 Dogs Act, allowing a revisit of “controversial breed-specific policies”.Cole Simons, the Minister of the Environment, told MPs this morning that the 2008 Act had been passed to head off problems arising from irresponsible ownership.After consultation, the Act is to come back before legislators to help “bridge the gap between the desires of those who want to own a prohibited or restricted breed, and the need for the Government to maintain security in the community”.Amendments to both the Act and the prohibited list will be presented “in short order”, Mr Simons said.
