President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday held a closed-door meeting with Nigeria’s former president, Olusegun Obasanjo.

The ex-President, however, refused to speak to state house correspondents after the meeting.

The President also met with Anglican bishops, led by the Primate of the Anglican Church in Nigeria, Archbishop Nicholas Okoh.
