It’s the film that made us all yearn to run on a giant keyboard, but the musical adaptation of classic 80’s film Big is set to hit the West End next year – and there’s some pretty impressive names forming the cast.

The Wanted’s Jay McGuiness will play Josh Baskin, the young boy who wakes up as an adult after visiting a mysterious arcade machine at a local carnival.

But he’s joined by an illustrious supporting cast that includes the likes of Denise Van Outen as Mrs Baskin, alongside Diana Vickers who plays Susan Lawrence.

Other big names include West End veteran Gary Wilmot as George MacMillan, and The Hoosiers’ singer Irwin Sparkes as Paul.

Irish audiences will get the chance to watch the show in December this year, before it transfers to London’s West End in 2017.
