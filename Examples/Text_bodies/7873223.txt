JOHANNESBURG - Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane says the body of the remaining mineworker, trapped at Impala Platinum’s one shaft in Rustenburg, has been found.

Zwane was speaking on the last day of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) central committee meeting in Centurion.

The worker is one of two employees who were trapped underground following a rock fall last month.

Meanwhile, three mineworkers at the Lily Mine near Barberton are yet to be freed after they were trapped underground in February.

Minister Zwane says his department recently met with management at Implats to demand more be done to find the body of the missing mineworker.

“After our deliberations and commitment that should that not happen, next week we will camp in that mine until that body is recovered.”

He says he received news this morning that the body has now been found.

“The body has been identified under a big rock. We hope the family will be able to start closing this chapter.”

The minister says if decisive action isn’t taken now – he fears this year’s fatalities in the mining sector could exceed the 77 reported last year.
