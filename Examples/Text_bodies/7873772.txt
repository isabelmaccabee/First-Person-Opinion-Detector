Keep God out of IEBC matter, Uhuru tells CORD

03 June 2016, 18:02

Nairobi - President Uhuru Kenyatta says all Kenyans must live within the confines of the Constitution, for peace and harmony to exist.As reported by The Nation, Speaking during the 14th Annual National Prayer Breakfast, the

President vowed to protect the Constitution as per the oath he took,

when he was sworn in as Kenyaâs 4th President.The President touched on the continuing Independent Electoral and

Boundaries Commission (IEBC) stalemate, saying already the Constitution

is clear on how the commissioners should be removed from office.âGod gave us a way forward when he helped us put a new Constitution

in place. God has done his part, it is now for us Kenyans to do our

partâ¦ itâs as simple as that letâs not bring God into this story. God

has more important things to do for us as a country than help us sort

this,â he said.The Opposition has been pushing for the removal of the IEBC

commissioners, and on Thursday named a five-member team to hold dialogue

with the Jubilee Coalition.CORD leader Raila Odinga announced the resumption of the weekly

anti-IEBC protests following a one-week hiatus, after the government

side declined to engage in dialogue.Capital News further reported that President Kenyatta however said the law cannot be changed to suit the

interests of a few individuals, in a veiled attack on the Opposition,

which insists on dialogue on electoral reforms and other pertinent

issues ahead of next yearâs General Election.President Kenyatta asked the Opposition to be consistent and follow

the Constitution if they are honest in their push for reforms on the

IEBC.He decried the selective application of the Constitution by CORD,

saying the countryâs supreme law must be respected and used at all

times.âGod gave us a new Constitution that provides a way forward on the

IEBC. We must not only use the Constitution when it favours us but also

when it does not. We must not use the Constitution only for our

convenience,â President Kenyatta said.He said laws are not formulated to suit the interests of a few individuals but for the good of the nation.
