LOS ANGELES - Usain Bolt's 2008 Olympics 4x100 meters relay gold medal could be in jeopardy after team-mate Nesta Carter was identified as one of 32 athletes who failed a retrospective drugs test, the Jamaica Gleaner reported on Friday.

Jamaica's Nesta Carter (2R) poses with his teammates during the men's 4x100m relay medal ceremony at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games on August 23, 2008	The Gleaner said a retest of Carter's 'A' sample from the Beijing Games had found traces of the banned stimulant Methylexaneamine.The result of retests of Carter's 'B' sample was not yet known, the Gleaner said citing "well-placed sources".Carter, 30, ran the first leg for Jamaica's 4x100m relay team in Beijing, which also included Michael Frater, Asafa Powell and superstar Bolt.The team took gold in what was then a new world record of 37.10 seconds, ahead of Trinidad and Tobago and Japan.Carter was also a member of Jamaica's gold medal-winning relay teams at the 2011, 2013 and 2015 World Championships as well as the 2012 Olympic Games.If Carter is subjected to doping sanctions, it could mean Bolt stands to lose his relay gold.In previous doping cases where individual members of a medal-winning relay squad have tested positive, the whole team is stripped of their medal.The United States men's 4x100m team were stripped of their silver medals from the 2012 Olympics after Tyson Gay's doping case.
