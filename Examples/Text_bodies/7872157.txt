Just because it zips doesn’t mean it fits, Kylie Jenner.

The 18-year-old wore a skin-tight jumpsuit on Thursday night during an outing with Hailey Baldwin, Gigi Hadid and sister Kendall Jenner, but suffered a serious wardrobe malfunction.

While all eyes might have been on her cleavage, with her underboobs proudly on display in a criss-cross top, the real show-stopper was her outfit’s broken zipper.

Kylie chronicled the drama on Snapchat and enlisted someone’s help to fix it. But the zipper couldn’t be saved and Kylie was forced to exit the restaurant wearing a denim jacket over her rear and, worse, an annoyed look on her face.

Her glum attitude was recently captured on an episode of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” where cameras caught Kylie complaining about all the attention she receives.

“I missed out on being normal,” she said. “To be able to feel like I can get out of the car and nobody is staring at me.”
