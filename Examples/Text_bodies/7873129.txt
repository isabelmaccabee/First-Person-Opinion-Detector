Three men arrested in connection with the alleged murder of Lawrence French have been released on bail.  The men - aged 39, 40 and 42 - were arrested as part of the investigation into 50-year-old’s death.  They were arrested on suspicion of murder and aggravated burglary after Mr French died while reporting a break-in at his Alwent Road home in the Newport area of Middlesbrough.

A pensioner was also arrested as part of the investigation, on a sole allegation of handling stolen goods. He has also been bailed. Mr French collapsed at Middlesbrough Police Station on May 25 after becoming seriously ill and later died at James Cook Hospital. His injuries have not been released by police for “operational reasons”. A Cleveland Police spokesman said: “Police have extended the detention of the three men arrested on suspicion of murder and aggravated burglary in connection with the death of 50-year-old Lawrence French from Middlesbrough.

“The fourth man, a 66-year-old, who was arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods has been bailed pending further enquiries.” Neighbours told the Gazette how they heard “banging and shouting” from his home on the night of his alleged murder. Police believe Mr French may have been burgled at his home prior to his death.
