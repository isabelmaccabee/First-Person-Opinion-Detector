In a separate case last month, the appeals board ruled against sending another Syrian refugee back to Turkey on the grounds that the country would not uphold the rights to them owed under international treaties.

Since the outbreak of war in neighbouring Syria, Turkey has hosted more refugees than all other countries combined.

But it has also been accused of human rights abuses against those seeking safety within its borders, including shooting Syrian refugees on its southern frontier, and beating others in detention centres.

On Friday, Amnesty International described the EU deal as “reckless and illegal” and condemned European leaders for turning a blind eye to the country’s shortcomings.

As Turkey struggles to cope with the burden of more than three million refugees and migrants, most asylum claimants face years waiting for their cases to be dealt with. During this time, they receive little or no support to find shelter and sustenance for themselves and their families, leaving children as young as nine working to support families.

“In its relentless efforts to prevent irregular arrivals to Europe, the EU has wilfully misrepresented what is actually happening on the ground in Turkey,” said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International’s Director for Europe and Central Asia.

“While there is value in supporting and encouraging Turkey to develop a fully functioning asylum system, the EU cannot act as if it already exists.”
