If you're reading this article in an office with strident strip lighting and white-washed walls, then we urge you to take a moment to transport yourself to altogether more exotic locale via these sun-drenched Instagram accounts dedicated to the exoticism of travel. 

@pollyholiday@pollyholidayPhotographer Polly Brown may not spend the time dedicated to holidaying that she once did (her endlessly entertaining account @doholiday saw Brown and friend Rory travel the world recording their adventures, but is sadly no longer in operation) but the image-maker, who goes by the apt moniker Polly Holiday, remains dedicated to flitting from city to city making magic for all manner of creative clients – AnOther included. Adventures on planes, trains and automobiles ensue, but think mirror play,lounging around in hotel bathrooms and a lot of time spent naked rather than cocktails poolside and strolls at the beach. Documentary photography at it’s very very best.

@holidaymagazine@holidaymagazineFounded in the USA in 1946, international travel and style review Holiday magazine ran for a total of 31 years before closing in 1977, prior to its relaunch 37 years later, meaning that its current iteration is fuelled by a rich and gloriously fun-filled legacy. Today it takes the form of a biannual publication, “written in English, but its heart is French”, and continues on the theme of sending a writer and a renowned photographer to a singular destination to see what they can find.The publication’s Instagram account blends iconic images by masters of photography including Henri Cartier Bresson, Bruce Weber and René Burri, with snapshots of contemporary sun-dappled and soporific scenes, to build  beautifully curated and endlessly inspiring feed that will have you daydreaming about breakfast at the Ritz, dinner in Japan, and long winters spent skiing in Vermont in no time at all.

@lepostcard@lepostcardIf neither Polly Holiday nor Holiday magazine are providing the conventional tropicana required to scratch your summer itch, allow us topresent @lepostcard. The Instagram outpost of the website of the same name – an online resource which “profiles the travel-habits of influencers around the world”, to the unadulterated joy of its weekly visitors –  provides a dreamy and never-ending supply of tropical beaches, flamingoes, coconuts and palm trees, swimwear inspiration, rocky outcrops and turquoise oceans. Proof that you can be desk side and poolside at the very same time.
