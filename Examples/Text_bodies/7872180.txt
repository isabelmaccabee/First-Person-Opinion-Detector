Confirming the Thursday evening incident, North East Kadem chief, Morris Kopolo, said the body of the deceased was found in the house of the widow by a neighbor.

“We found a packet of insecticide, known as Lannate next to the body and we suspect he consumed it,” said Kapolo.

Kapolo noted that preliminary investigation established that the deceased had differences with the woman, something the suspect may have led to his committing suicide.

The widow has been ordered to record a statement with police. The body of the deceased was moved to Migori Level Four Hospital awaiting an autopsy.
