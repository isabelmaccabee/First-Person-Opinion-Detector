"A lacklustre performance from England’s three attacking options results in a 0-0 stalemate through 120 minutes.

"Poland’s Karol Linetty, a second half sub, sees red during extra-time for a reckless lunge on James Milner. England then go on to do something that they haven’t done since 1996 – win a penalty shootout.

"All four of their spot-kick takers score (Vardy, Rooney, Milner, Stones) while only Lewandowski finds the net for the Poles. Wayne Rooney’s eight key passes from the attacking midfield spot are the only highlight in a poor showing from England’s attackers. Danny Rose is named Man of the Match."
