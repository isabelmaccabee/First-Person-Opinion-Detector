Kanye is not playing around with the guest list for his new single “Round & Round.” This morning, he appeared on the Los Angeles radio station Real 92.3 to debut the new track, which he says is the first single from his forthcoming G.O.O.D. Music compilation Cruel Winter. Talking on the radio, West said that the song might not be done yet and that he might remix it a few times before releasing it. Nevertheless, the song has an absolutely nuts list of collaborators: Travis Scott, Desiigner, Big Sean, Gucci Mane, Quavo, 2 Chainz, Yo Gotti. Given all the names on this track, it’s probably not a surprise that nobody gets a whole lot of time, though the just-out-of-jail Gucci Mane does get two verses. But it’s a whole lot of song, and you can hear a radio rip of it below, via Miss Info.

Don’t hold your breath for Cruel Winter.
