Today in ‘EVERYTHING YOU’RE DOING IS BAD, STOP IT, STOP IT NOW’ news, sitting down at your desk all day isn’t just ruining your posture and your insides, it’s also damaging something really important: your bum.

We know. It’s horrifying. And we need to take a stand (literally).

Self spoke to physical therapist Dan Giordano, who explained that sitting down all day is effectively ruining all the hard work we’ve done through our squat routine.

He explained that when you spend most of your day sitting, ‘your glutes shut down’, causing negative effects not just for the bum, but for your entire body. Oh dear.

This can make your bum significantly less perky, as inhibited glutes won’t work properly, and over time, this will make them become weaker.

Sitting can even change the shape of your bum. Giordano says he’s seen clients who’ve gone from active jobs to desk jobs and ended up having a flatter butt.

Oh, and sitting can make you have more cellulite. Adam Gallo explained that being inactive all day means your blood won’t be pumped properly around the body, causing a lack of blood flow to the skin, which then causes a loss of collagen. Cue cellulite.

Sh*t.

Thankfully, there is an answer to all these sitting-related bum woes. You just need to make sure your posture is in check, take regular breaks from your chair, and make sure you’re doing targeted workouts. You can also ensure your glutes stay active during the day by clenching and releasing in your seat.
