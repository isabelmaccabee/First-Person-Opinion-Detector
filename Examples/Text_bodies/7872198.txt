The court heard the student, who had been a virgin, had since dropped out of her course at the University of Birmingham.

Judge Stacey told the pair: "What you both did to her had devastating consequences. After achieving her goal of getting into a top university because of your actions she dropped out.

"She no longer goes out on her own and feels wary and fearful. She was clearly abducted, she had to be held up and was unable to walk unaided. She was totally incapable.

"Abbas, you took her virginity from her which can never be reclaimed, you took her innocence and ruined her time in Birmingham.

"Both of you have shown no remorse and have cynically attempted to portray her as a sexual predator when the exact opposite was true."

Abbas, of Small Heath, Birmingham, and Hussain, of Bordesley Green, Birmingham, denied wrong-doing, but were both convicted by separate juries.

The judge praised their victim, who endured two trials, saying: "I pay tribute to her strength and courage coming forward.Â 

"Her bravery and dignity impressed everyone at court. Her actions resulted in you both being brought to justice."
