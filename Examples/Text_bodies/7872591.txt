A new series starring the old Top Gear team of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May will record its first segments in South Africa from July, according to the BBC. The Grand Tour will launch on Amazon Prime with each episode's pre-recorded studio segments filmed in a different country. Photos uploaded to The Grand Tour's Facebook page show the trio have already begun shooting in Portugal, Germany, Barbados and North Africa.

The first broadcast episode will be shot in Johannesburg. When one South African fan asked if the news was true, Hammond confirmed and suggested the team hold a braai.

"Yes, for real. We'll have to have a Bra, a Bray, a, oh you know, a South African barbecue," he wrote.

May joked on Twitter that the location of The Grand Tour was "chosen by Richard Hammond, who's run out of biltong".

Last June, the former hosts of the popular BBC car show were in South Africa to host the action motoring festival Clarkson, Hammond and May Live. The car nuts had just quit the show after Clarkson's suspension for punching show producer Oisin Tymon. The trio were replaced on the show by former Friends actor Matt LeBlanc, BBC Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans, and an extensive cast of co-presenters. The new series of Top Gear made its debut on Sunday to more than 4-million viewers, and mixed reviews.

On 2 June, the show's Facebook page announced: "It's official. First stop: Johannesburg."

Jay Marine, vice president of Amazon Video Europe, said: "Given the popularity of Jeremy, Richard and James in South Africa, Johannesburg is a fantastic place to start."
