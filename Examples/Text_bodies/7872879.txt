Two off duty police officers saved a man’s life after they found him unconscious and not breathing on their way home from a night out.

PC Emily Richardson from the Road Transport Policing Command and PC Tom Upton, who serves in Hammersmith and Fulham, were in Kingston when they heard “commotion” in a nearby street.

The police officers discovered a man lying unresponsive on the ground and began first aid in an attempt to revive him.

PC Richardson carried out six cycles of chest compressions before the man began breathing again.

But after he was placed into the recovery position and the police officers were joined by on duty colleagues, the man stopped breathing again.

The female police officer carried out CPR again and the man caught his breath as paramedics arrived.

The man was stabilised and taken to a major trauma centre where he was placed into intensive care.

He is expected to make a full recovery after the ordeal last month.

A Kingston Police spokesman said: “The officers came in yesterday to see the Borough Commander at Kingston on their day off so he could thank them personally. They will be awarded a commendation at our upcoming awards ceremony.

“Imagine if they had gone a different way home or not heard the commotion. We would like to publicly thank them for what they did.”
