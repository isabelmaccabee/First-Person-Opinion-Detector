The Polish move has been mirrored in the ex-Soviet Baltic states, which have a long history of tension with Moscow. Paramilitary groups from these countries also attended the conference in Ostroda.

Poland already has a paramilitary group, a "riflemen's association" called the Strzelec, set up in the early 20th century by the architect of Polish independence, Jozef Pilsudski.

It has around 12,000 volunteers, many of them youngsters, who get training in military skills.

Strzelec units are to take part for the first time in a major military exercise, Anakonda, gathering Poland and several Nato allies, Strzelec commander Marcin Waszczuk told AFP. The exercise is due to take place in Poland from June 7 to 17.
