Inmates at an open prison are getting their exercise on a nine-hole pitch and putt golf course built behind prison walls.  Others enjoy nature trails and birdwatching in the woodland within the grounds of Leyhill Prison in rural Gloucestershire. Older inmates tend a vegetable plot and take part in games of 'walking football', or make cushions and quilt covers in needlework classes. Cookery lessons and sing-alongs were also said to be popular. A report by the visiting group the Independent Monitoring Board revealed the relaxed regime at the jail, where prisoners mix freely from 8.30am to 11pm and can access the library and gym seven days a week.

The prison has its own nine-hole pich and putt golf course

A review of the institution by the IMB gave a glimpse into the peaceful system run by warders at the prison, a former US Air Force camp. The report said: “A recent list of activity sessions contained 26 different areas of activity, in addition to 9 topics on which there were talks or presentations. “A sample includes: peer support and training for 50+ carers; personal plans for individuals with needs which are sustainable and embedded into all services; Living Wills; Fine Cell work; cookery classes using vegetables grown in offenders’ own allotments; sing-alongs organised by offenders themselves; and, when the weather is favourable, pitch & putt, walking football, and organised walks around the grounds.”
