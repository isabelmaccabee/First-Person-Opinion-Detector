Suitable for both seasoned chefs and those who are only first starting out in the kitchen, this intelligent and interactive slow cooker from Tefal promises to revolutionise the way you cook.

The cooker comes with a pre-programmed library of 50 recipes and an LCD screen that tells you exactly how much of each ingredient you should use as well as automatically setting itself to the right temperature to make your dish.Â It also has a handy "keep warm" function, keeping your dish warm for up to an hour and a half after cooking, and can be timed to start up to 15 hours in advance.

Although it is easy to clean and comes with a detachable plug, making it dishwasher friendly, it is a bit on the large side, so would suit those with a little extra space in their kitchen.
