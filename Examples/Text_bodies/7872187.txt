Over the last week I imagine Roy has been doing exactly the same with his England squad – drilling them, developing them, coaching them into a side that is ready for next Saturday’s game against Russia. He will have a plan in mind and while I would not want to second-guess, I am sure that a counter-attacking team is one of the options he is considering.

It is an unusual situation to watch tournaments as a club manager but I cannot wait for Euro 2016 to start. I will be honest with you, mainly I am hoping that none of my Bayern Munich players get injured. There are 10 of them at the tournament, including five with Germany, and I wish them all well. 

Watching these games is a treat for a club manager because sometimes you see a player of your own in a different way, played in another position, revealing a quality you had not seen before. And if the experiment goes wrong? That’s another manager’s problem!

Of course, when next Sunday comes around for Italy’s first game against Belgium in Lyon, I will have my Azzuri shirt on, and there will be only one team I want to win.
