It's been a difficult time in the world of celebrity relationships. Both Tayvin and Zigi are reportedly broken up, and fans are feeling the palpable romantic unease in the air. Leave it to The Vamps to put everyone's minds at rest about the relationship that really matters!

James McVey weighed in on all the celebrity breakups going on, and reassured us all that Brad Simpson and Tristan Evans are still very much a thing. Phew!

"After seeing these supposed celeb breakups, I wanted to lay your minds at rest- Brad is still very happy with Tris," he wrote.
