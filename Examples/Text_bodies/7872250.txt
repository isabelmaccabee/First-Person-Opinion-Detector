True story: I met Kit Harington’s beard, once.

One unassuming, lazy spring day, it waltzed into the charming SoHo eatery I once worked in. It was attached to “Game of Thrones” star Kit Harington.

Kit’s Beard sat in my section, I recommended the shrimp and grits and, together, Kit and Kit’s beard enjoyed a traditionally southern meal as I watched from a close distance.

Those days — the ones of succulent crustaceans tickled by coarse, curly facial hair — are over.

KIT HARINGTON SHAVED HIS FACE, UHKAY?

Photos shared by fans Thursday evening on Twitter show a clean-shaven KitKat.

Despite the 29-year-old’s ceaseless beauty, regardless of what is or is not on his face, some “GoT” fans are taking the loss hard.

Some are speculating Kit’s new babyface foreshadows a grim fate for his “GoT” character Jon Snow.

Don’t worry, peaches. It’ll grow back. In the meantime, we’ll just have to suck it up and watch Kit eat shrimp the plain ol’ hairless way.
