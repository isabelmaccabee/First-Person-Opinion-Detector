BooksActually boss Keny Leck says: "The whole idea is about accessibility and eyeballs.

“There are not enough bookstores in Singapore, so we’ve previously also distributed (our books) to places such as (retail stores) Cat Socrates and Naiise’s pop-up stores. You have a different sort of demographic in these places.

“These vending machines could be a visual touchpoint. You may not buy (a book) but we’ll let you know these exist. And from there, there could be more possibilities.

"We start with visual awareness: Books where you see a local author’s name.”

The machines are cash-only at the moment, but Mr Leck told Channel News Asia he hopes to introduces cashless payment in due course.

“The ultimate place we want to put them are at train stations,” he said. “BooksActually cannot be at Jurong MRT station every day, but it would be perfect if there was a vending machine there.”

Mr Leck says he got the idea from the ‘Penguincubator’, a similar machine rolled out by Penguin Books n London in the 1930s.
