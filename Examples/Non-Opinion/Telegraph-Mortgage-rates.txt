Home buyers in April paid the lowest interest rates ever on their mortgages, according to the Bank of England.

Earlier in the year banks and building societies scrapped some of the best deals on offer because they expected the Bank of England to start raising interest rates.

Since then, however, forecasts for a rate rise have been pushed back, and some Bank of England officials have even discussed the possibility of a cut to the base rate to below its current 0.5pc level.

As a result, mortgage rates are once again falling. In April, the average borrower paid just 2.41pc on a new mortgage, down from 2.49pc in March and 2.64pc in April 2015.

Five years ago the average rate was 3.84pc. The Bank of England's data go back to 2004. In April of that year, the average mortgage rate was 4.55pc.

The Bank of England’s data also showed that mortgage lending so far this year is at its highest level since the financial crisis.

A total of 497,301 mortgages were given out between January and April, up 17.6pc on the same period a year earlier.

The pace of lending, however, has varied.

In March, lenders gave out 124,429 mortgages, up 19pc year-on-year, as buy-to-let investors scrambled to beat the rise in stamp duty on second properties which came into effect in April.

As a result, lending fell to 119,796 mortgages in April, with annual growth slowing to just 4.5pc.

“The strong suspicion is that housing market activity will be under pressure in the immediate term by a combination of weakened interest from the buy-to-let and second home sectors as well as heightened concerns and uncertainties over the UK economic outlook, particularly in the run-up to June’s referendum on EU membership,” said Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight.

“Nevertheless, we expect housing market activity to regain limited momentum in the latter months of 2016 on the assumption that a vote to stay in the EU reduces uncertainty and supports a pick-up in economic activity. High employment, decent purchasing power and the probability that interest rates will not rise for some considerable time to come should underpin house buyer interest," he said, adding that a shortage of properties will also support house prices.”

Interest rates on personal loans have also fallen, close to a new record low.

The average rate on a £10,000 loan in April was 4.3pc, just above the record low of 4.25pc recorded in June last year. In a similar pattern to mortgages, rates increased in anticipation of a Bank of England rate hike, only to fall back when the prospect of policy tightening receded.
