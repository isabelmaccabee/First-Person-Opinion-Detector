An 18-year-old man is recovering in hospital after plunging from the balcony of a theatre during an evening show.

Police were called to the Grand Theatre in Blackpool to reports that a man had jumped from a balcony during a performance of Grease the Musical.

As he landed, he caught the shoulder of a woman who was sitting in the stalls.

A spokeswoman for Lancashire police said: “As he landed, he caught the shoulder of a woman on the end of one of the rows; however, she was uninjured and did not require medical attention.

“The ambulance service attended and the man was taken to Royal Preston hospital. His injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.”

The incident happened at about 9.30pm on Thursday and the performance was subsequently cancelled.

The theatre later made a statement on Twitter.
